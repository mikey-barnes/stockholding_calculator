Stockholding Calculator
========================

This project was built to make (crude) inventory forcasting suggestions based on recent sales history and current stockholding.

## How To

The calculator operates using two files which must be locaed in the same directory as the project files. These two files are product-export.csv and sales-data.csv.
Whilst product-export.csv is the fixed name given to inventory exports from the Lightspeed software, sales-data.csv must be manually named as such by the user as 
exported sales report data is dynamically named based on the date of the report contents.
